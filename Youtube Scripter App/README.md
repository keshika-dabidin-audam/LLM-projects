# Automating YouTube Script Writing with LangChain and Streamlit
LangChain is a natural language processing capability that generates high-quality, human-like language. In this project, we will build a youtube script-generating tool using LangChain and Streamlit.

The application’s interface is designed using Streamlit, which provides a user-friendly experience for the creators.

The application’s prompt templates and chat history storage capabilities make it easy for creators to customize the generated scripts to their specific needs. Moreover, the language model generates not only the script but also the video title, making the tool a comprehensive solution for YouTube creators.
